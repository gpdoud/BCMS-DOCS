# Calendar Model (class)

## Overview

The `Calendar` model is the primary model that supports that calendar function for cohorts. It works with the `CalendarDay` model to provide the complete calendar function.

## Properties

The `Calendar` has a number of important properties.

The `StartDate` of a cohort is used when a calendar is ***cloned*** meaning it is created by copying the calendar days from another calendar.

The `Tyoe` identifies the calendar as either a full-time (FT) or part-time (PT). This is important because a full-time cohort has class days Monday thru Friday and a part-time cohort has class days on only Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday. The `Type` property tells the cloning process which days of the week can contain class days.

The `Tenplate`, when set to `true` means it exists to be cloned to create new calendars rather than being assigned to a cohort. The cloning process can use a template calendar or a non-template calendar.

## Functions

### Clone

The `Clone` function creates a new calendar by copying the days from an existing calendar. The existing calendar can be a template or not. The new calendar will have the same number of class days as the existing calendar. It works by simply selecting the existing calendar and the start date of the new calendar. The days in the existing calendar are processed, existing calendar day is changed along with the week and day numbers are added to the new calendar.
